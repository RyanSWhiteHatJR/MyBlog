            <p class="text-muted text-left">The Sydney Opera House is a amazing and awesome building! The design looks super cool and inside is even cooler! They use the Opera House for opera, duh, my school has even contested against other schools in the Sydney Opera House for choir and band. It is an amazing place and it has an awesome view at the Harbour Bridge next to it, at the end of every year, the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge always launch fireworks into the sky at night time. In conclusion, the Opera House is an amazing building and I recommend you to visit it as well!</p>

            <p class="text-muted text-left">I visited the Sky Tower back in 2019, it's a very tall tower and it has a great view at the city, to access the Sky Tower, you have to buy a ticket at the bottom (Which is located at a shopping mall) then you ride a elevator all the way to the top where you get the best view at the entire city, very recently they have realsed a "Lego Exbitidion" there, I was one of the first people to enter and be shocked and amazed by all the lego sets and pieces. I would highley recommend you to visit the Sky Tower too!</p>

            <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you'll miss 40% of the fun. At minium: Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Ant Man and the Wasp. The Problem is that the whole movie is homage to all the movies, Yet you will enjoy it a lot. There is at the beginning of the movie a (spolier alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles. Must go to the bathroom just before the movie because it does last 3 hours.</p>

            <p>When I was younger I never acknoledged the Lion King or even liked it, but after reading the book and the old cartoon movie I was happier than ever when I found out that this movie was coming out! Even though the movie had the exact same plot and storyline, I still loved it! I don't know why but seeing the movie with realistic graphics make it 10x better and more better looking! Definetly the best movie I have seen in a while.</p>

            <p>Ever since I was a kid, I've always been in love with Spiderman and I've always thought that more people (Mostly Adults) should appreciate him more and the fact that a new movie which only focusses on Spiderman makes me the happiest person on the planet! I absolutely LOVE the movie I HIGHLY recommend you to watch the movie too!</p>

            The state of Rondônia in western Brazil — once home to 208,000 square kilometers of forest (about 51.4 million acres), an area slightly smaller than the state of Kansas — has become one of the most deforested parts of the Amazon. In the past three decades, clearing and degradation of the state’s forests have been rapid: 4,200 square kilometers cleared by 1978; 30,000 by 1988; and 53,300 by 1998. By 2003, an estimated 67,764 square kilometers of rainforest—an area larger than the state of West Virginia—had been cleared.

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">
            This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning. Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs. The number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in South Africa. Current SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics continue to detect this variant. Several labs have indicated that for one widely used PCR test, one of the three target genes is not detected (called S gene dropout or S gene target failure) and this test can therefore be used as marker for this variant, pending sequencing confirmation. Using this approach, this variant has been detected at faster rates than previous surges in infection, suggesting that this variant may have a growth advantage.
